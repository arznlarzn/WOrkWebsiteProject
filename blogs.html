                <p><br><br>BadBuddhist was going to be about Mindfulness in <b>Recovery</b>, but now that I have been sober for sometime, I find that:<br>The recognition of awareness, <b>consciousness as it is</b>,<br>is something Everyone should explore.<br>The usual response for people is to assume this is some airy-fairy make-believe new-wave bullshit.<br>But when we test it for ourselves, what awaits us is truly <i>life-changing</i>.<br>It doesn't promise freedom from pain, but rather, a promise of equanimity, despite it.</p>

                <p><br><br>I am well versed in technology and electronics, and what to look for when buying them. I worked for Best Buy for something like 4 years, but that really only sparked my passion. I have in the last few years taught myself to program in a variety of languages, such as Python, C#, and your basic web languages, like HTML, CSS, and JS. I have interest in low-level languages like C, Rust, and Go. I have dabbled with Unreal, Unity, and Godot and have created some pixel art characters in Krita and plan to make some kind platformer games to start with. I custom hardline water-cooled my PC for the first time, which you can view as a project <a href="/projects.html?project=A Custom Water Loop">here</a>.<br><br>And I play games. More than you, probably. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArZnlaRz">Here's my Steam Profile.</a></p>

                <p><br><br>In 2020, I was writing primarily, if not solely, about recovery. There was a bit of 'mindfulness', but I had just entered back into society and into my life from several years of hard, relentless addiction. Recovery is still just as relevant to me now as it was then, however, I have found that I am passionate about more than just my recovery. I want to only write real, meaningful things about recovery and my experiences in it.<br><br> And I am not some poser, either. I'm a real, down-bad, bottom-barrel, homeless junkie. Just...<br><u>Not anymore.</u></p>
