                <p>The first thing I wanted to create when I <i>re-entered</i> the civilized world, from the chaos that was my life, was BadBuddhist. A blog about Mindfulness in Recovery. I felt a connection to something for the first time in years.<br><br>I'd been interested in Buddhism for a long time and really 'wanted' to be a 'meditator'.üòÖ<br>It turns out- the actual experience of... experience, is worth exploring, in-and-of itself.<br><br>A common response for many is to assume this is just more airy-fairy, make-believe, new-wave, love-and-light bullshit that you see everywhere.<br><span id="biggerText"><b>This</b> <u>is not</u> <i>that</i></span>.<br><br>Why don't you find out for yourself?</p>

                <p><br><br>I am well versed in technology and electronics, and definitely know what to look for when buying them. I worked for Best Buy for around 4 years, but that really only sparked my passion. I have taught myself to program in a variety of languages, such as Python, C#, and your basic web languages, like HTML, CSS, and JS. I have interest in low-level languages like C, Rust, and Go. I have dabbled with Unreal, Unity, and Godot and have created some pixel art characters in Krita and plan to make some kind platformer games to start with. I custom hardline water-cooled my PC for the first time, which you can view as a project <a href="/projects.html?project=A Custom Water Loop">here</a>.<br><br>And I play games. More than you, probably. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArZnlaRz">Here's my Steam Profile.</a></p>

                <p><br><br>In 2020, I was writing primarily, if not solely, about recovery. There was a bit of 'mindfulness', but I had just entered back into society and into my life from several years of hard, relentless addiction. Recovery is still just as relevant to me now as it was then, however, I have found that I am passionate about more than just my recovery. I want to only write real, meaningful things about recovery and my experiences in it.<br><br> And I am not some poser, either. I'm a real, down-bad, bottom-barrel, homeless junkie. Just...<br><u>Not anymore.</u></p>
