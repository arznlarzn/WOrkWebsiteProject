                <h3>At least, he really want's to be.</h3><br><p>I think this is less about wanting to 'be' anything, and more about wanting to share what feels important. For all of the people who don't know; the people that don't realize what they <i>really,</i> really are; the
                    people that are hung up; that ask themselves "what am I doing here?"... But this is actually, all of us.<br><br> Some things just feel too important not to do something,
                    <br> and for me, this is just the beginning of the <i>something</i>.<br><br> Here's what I write about:

                <br><br>BadBuddhist was my first attempt at creating anything when I first got sober. The plan was:
                it was to be a blog about Mindfulness In Recovery. Totally sounds excellent and it's two things I absolutely
                love. To create something that could actually be successful, I realized pretty quickly that I would need to put
                in a lot more work than I was actually willing to do at the time. Unfortunately, I believe I lost all of the
                posts I'd originally wrote. However, I would rather seperate these topics. Under BadBuddhist, I am going to write 
                about mindfulness and awareness/conciousness.

                <br><br>I realize that I hold much more knowledge than your average person when it comes to technology, electronics, and how to shop
                and what to look for in such things. I worked for Best Buy for something like 4 years, but that only gave me entry into the
                world of technology. I learned a lot while I was there and became some what of a laymen expert, however, I discovered that this
                was a passion that I had never realized before. So, here I will write about technology.
