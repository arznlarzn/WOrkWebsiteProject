                <p><br><br>BadBuddhist was my first attempt at creating anything when I first got sober. The plan was:
                it was to be a blog about Mindfulness In Recovery. Totally sounds excellent and it's two things I absolutely
                love. To create something that could actually be successful, I realized pretty quickly that I would need to put
                in a lot more work than I was actually willing to do at the time. Unfortunately, I believe I lost all of the
                posts I'd originally wrote. However, I would rather seperate these topics. Under BadBuddhist, I am going to write 
                about mindfulness and awareness/conciousness.</p>

                <p><br><br>I know some things when it comes to technology, electronics, and what to look for when buying them. I worked for Best Buy for something like 4 years, but that really only sparked my passion. I have in the last few years taught myself to program in Python, some C#, and have interest in low-level languages like C. I have dabbled with Unreal, Unity, and Godot and have created some pixel art characters in Krita and plan to make some kind platformer games to start with. I custom hardline water-cooled my PC for the first time, which you can view as a project <a href="/projects.html?project=A Custom Water Loop">here</a>.</p>

                <p><br><br>In 2020, I was writing primarily, if not solely, about recovery. There was a bit of 'mindfulness', but I had just entered back into society and into my life from several years of hard, relentless addiction. Recovery is still just as relevant to me now as it was then, however, I have found that I am passionate about more than just my recovery. I want to only write real, meaningful things about recovery and my experiences in it. And I am not some poser, either. I'm a real, down-bad, bottom-barrel, homeless junkie. But not anymore.</p>
