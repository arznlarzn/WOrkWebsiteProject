These are the files for larsondavis.io

**IMPORTANT - Currently, if you go to larsondavis.io, the page you are visiting is the underconstruction.html file. I currently have it renamed to
index.html so that it is the landing page for my website currently. All links are circling back to the same page. However, when I make the next updates, I will, change the files back to their original names.\
Currently, my index.html file is called main.html**


Yes, everything is currently hardcoded.
This was a concscious choice.
It contains no valuable information, no api's (as of yet), or anything like this.
It will just contain pages for my different coding projects, for my blog posts, and for my own music projects.
I may update this in the future so that my blog posts are pulled through MySQL,
but as of now, my purpose of all of this is just to learn, get my different projects out there, and have a dedicated Portfolio.

As of now, it's not very pretty and most likely, I will change everything.
But for now, it's working and I am very happy with this. =]
